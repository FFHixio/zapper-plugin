    The Zapper plugin helps to run OWASP ZAP as part of your automated security assessment regime in the Jenkins continuous
    integration system. The plugin can use a pre-installed version of ZAP when given the path to the ZAP installation.
    Alternatively, it can automatically download and build a version of ZAP to be used by your security tests.
