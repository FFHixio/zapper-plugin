<div>
  Specify the SVN repository to retrieve OWASP ZAP from, and Zapper will automatically download (check out) the
  repository, build it, and run it for you. Zapper will track the <strong>SVN HEAD</strong>. This means that Zapper
  will automatically check for the latest and greatest version of ZAP and build it whenever new ZAP code is developed
  and added to the repository.
